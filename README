This branch is based on revision 570. The stable one.

It's sole purpose is to make FFDECSA (via sasc's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.

You can use it with kernel version 3.x and up, including more recent kernels (3.7.x and up)

dvbdev.h is included for all cases, so you don't have to set --dvb-dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. It is still possible though.

If you are running Debian, you don't need to recompile your kernel anymore, the running kernel will be properly patched. Just checkout the debian branch.

USAGE:
git clone https://github.com/bas-t/sasc.git
cd sasc/contrib/sasc-ng
git checkout stable
./configure <opts>
make && make module

If you know what FFDECSA optimisation is best for you, you can set it like:

./configure --compiletype=release --ffdecsa_mode=PARALLEL_128_SSE
